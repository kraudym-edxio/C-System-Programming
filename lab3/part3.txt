The reason why ch != EOF is always true 
when using unsigned char in filesize1v.c
is because unsigned char does not undergo
promotion. It will always be a smaller 
value than the value of EOF. Since the value
will always be smaller, ch and EOF can never 
be equal. This is why the do while loop gets
executed and infinite amount of times.
