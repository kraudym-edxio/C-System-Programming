A) The file size reported by OS for this file is 351 bytes.

B) fseek(fd, 10L, SEEK_SET) acts as a pointer to the first 10
   characters at the beginning of the file- beginning of file is
   specified by SEEK_SET.

C) The file size reported by running ./filesize2 filesize2.c 
   is 10 bytes. This reported size is different from the size
   in part a) because uncommenting 
		
	fseek(fd, 10L, SEEK_SET); 
	putc(-1, fd);
	rewind(fd); 
	
  will cause ONLY the first ten charactes to be considered, hence 
  the file size will only be ten bytes.
