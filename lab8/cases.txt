For case 1 (pcsc1.c):
	
	Child is running
	User defined signal 1

	The above two statements are the output for 
	case 1 modification. The child print statement is
	executed and a prompt informing us of SIGUSR1 is shown.
	The pause() function is not used in parallel to the parent's
	call to kill(). Since this coordination is not present, there 
	is not an infinite loop and the program terminates- switching
	does not occur.
