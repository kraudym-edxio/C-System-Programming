Lab Section 51


I added two print statements to proc_line.c
in order to achieve the appropriate print out.
One print statement was added to the case ARG: block
and one print statement was added to the case EOL: block.
This is so because arg will assume the value of the user inputted
token at these cases of the switch block.
